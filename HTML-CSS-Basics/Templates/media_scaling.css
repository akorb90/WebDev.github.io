/*

The example above scales the width of an image (or video) to the width of a container.
If the image is larger than the container, the vertical portion of the image will overflow and will not display.
To swap this behavior, you can set max-height to 100% and width to auto (essentially swapping the values).
This will scale the height of the image with the height of the container instead.
If the image is larger than the container, the horizontal portion of the image will overflow and not display.
